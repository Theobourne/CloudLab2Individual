# Make Scripts Executable

If you're on Linux or Mac, run this to make the deployment script executable:

```bash
chmod +x k8s/deploy.sh
```

Or run this command from the repository root:

```bash
chmod +x k8s/*.sh
```

Then you can run:

```bash
./k8s/deploy.sh
```

## For Windows Users

Simply run:

```cmd
k8s\deploy.bat
```

No additional permissions needed!
